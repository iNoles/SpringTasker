# SpringTasker - Spring Boot & Kotlin üöÄ

SpringTasker is a task management application built using Spring Boot and Kotlin. It supports both session-based authentication with CSRF protection for form-based logins and JWT-based authentication for API access. The application leverages H2 Database for persistence and follows clean, modular design principles for efficient task management.

## Features üåü

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based login/logout for UI users
- JWT-based authentication for API clients

### Managing Tasks
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Set priority levels (Low, Medium, High)

### Security Enhancements
- CSRF protection for form logins
- Stateless JWT-based authentication for APIs

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Kotlin**: Primary language
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for rapid development
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secure API authentication
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight, embedded database
- **Thymeleaf**: Server-side template engine for UI
- **Gradle**: Build tool for dependency management
